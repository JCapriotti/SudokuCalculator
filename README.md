What Does It Do?
================
I used this to help solve [Killer Sudoku](http://krazydad.com/killersudoku/) puzzles. Given a desired sum and how many terms make up the sum, it calculates all the possible terms that yield the sum. You can optionally provide terms that either must or must not be included in the results.
